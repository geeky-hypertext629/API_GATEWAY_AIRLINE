FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and microservices
- Using this middle-end, when client sends req we will be able to make decision that which microservice will respond to the request,
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting,
- We try to prepare an API for Gateway that acts as this middle end.
